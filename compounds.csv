Also, on your last ""lesson,"" I would agree with the point, but as a community college student who's looking to transfer to a 4-year uni., I would say there's a big difference in the sense that I have to make more of an effort to find those ""exceptional and inspirational"" people.

Its one of those schools people that choose because the standard is pretty low. But ots what my mom can afford to so i have no other choice. Plus i spent my last two years of high school with better and way smarter classmates that made feel inferior and down because somehow i was less than them. They all seem for greatness. I saw it I felt it. Even the teachers knew who was meant for greatness and i wasnt one of them. 

But Thank you John Fish. This means so much to me. 

I love your channel.

It gives me hope maybe someday or somehow i'll be able to study abroad. Be sorrounded with good people. I hope so. Maybe I'll grow and have an enriching education and life.

"Your rule number five is spot on.  I have been to multiple universities and experienced others through children. My father always said that the difference between the elite school and the state school was that the state school had elite people but also a lot of regular, hard working kids too. It‚Äôs who you surround yourself with, how much you engage with professors and how much effort you put into it. It also depends on the area of study. Some very specific degrees are well done on universities that you don‚Äôt expect. Each school has a niche. I‚Äôve definitely learned that admissions and happiness and then ultimate success at a school has a lot to do with the student fitting the school but also the school fitting the student.

"MESSAGE TO HARDWORKING HARVARD STUDENTS.....
I lived in CT for 16 years, graduated Wesleyan University, where I studied government & law, and my favorite professor was a Harvard graduate.  LET ME SHARE MY NIGHTMARE WITH YOU and I suggest you listen because your degrees will be worthless if you don't!  Many of you will find this ""BEYOND COMPREHENSION,"" just as I did for 17 years.

Upon graduating Wesleyan, I chose not to invest into law school because the market was saturated with attorneys in the late 80's & professor Robert C. Wood questioned how anyone was going to make money unless they were ""the brightest & best.""  Over the years, I watched lawyers double, triple then quadruple the cost of divorces, etc.  Eventually, they reached a threshold and some fees became controlled.  So how have so many lawyers continued to practice law in America?  Big investments (debt), egos, sense of entitlement, unwillingness to relocate, etc. led a slew of attorneys to take the low road & illegally bleed Americans.

DESPERATE DEMOCRAT LIBERAL LAWYERS HAVE BEEN KEEPING A BIG SECRET FOR DECADES!  LIBERAL ATTY'S, COPS & FED'S HAVE OPERATED AN INTERNATIONAL DRUG MAFIA FOR OVER 30 YEARS, NOW A MASSIVE DICTATORSHIP, THAT TERRORIZES LIVES & HAS CAUSED THE DEATHS OF MANY CHILDREN & ADULTS.  SOME MAFIA ATTORNEYS ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN NATIONWIDE MONEY LAUNDERING, CREDIT CARD SCAM, IDENTITY THEFT & HUMAN TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS.  

I am a victim of their illegal charade in which 22 years of my life has been stolen, my family destroyed and, at age 59, I am fighting for my life & freedom.  Five years ago, after catching the Mafia in an act, I learned that all the bizarre incidents, abuse & financial setbacks that I endured since moving to SWFL in 1996 were not bad luck or a coincidence but rather deliberately planned terrorist stunts by Liberal Mafia Thug lawyers, cops, business-owners, Fed'l agents, school officials, etc.  My life has been stolen & terrorized because Liberal Mafia FED's did not do their job for over 3 decades while collecting fat paychecks, enjoying 3-6 week vacations annually, traveling all over the world & having healthy pensions awaiting!

I WANT THESE MONSTERS IN PRISON, THUS, I SPENT THE PAST 5 YEARS (WHILE ISOLATED & ALONE FOR 3-1/2 YEARS) REVIEWING 17 YEARS OF FILES, EMAILS, CALENDARS & PHONE RECORDS AS WELL AS STUDYING & RESEARCHING FRIENDS, CLIENTS, ACQUAINTANCES & QUESTIONABLE RESIDENTS.  I WAS IMMEDIATELY SWARMED BY THE DEA, FBI & CIA AFTER I BEGAN SCREAMING TO THE POLICE & CITY MANAGER IN 2013 THAT I WAS BEING SPIED ON IN MY OWN HOME.  WITHIN 6 MONTHS, I LEARNED THE COPS WERE CORRUPT SO I BEGAN SENDING DETAILS & RESEARCH TO THE FED'S.  5 YEARS LATER, I AM STILL SWARMED EVERY TIME I STEP OUT MY DOOR (TAKING PHOTOS & DOCUMENTING EACH INCIDENT) & AM JUST WRAPPING UP MOST OF MY WORK!  While working endlessly on a Mafia project ""Bigger Than God,"" I struggle emotionally to come to grip with this nightmare.

The Terrorist Mafia Brotherhood was spearheaded by Liberal, White-Supremacist, Atheist, Chauvinist, Party-Boy Predators who have been living big in paradise (waterfront homes, homes with acreage, boats, constant parties, womanizing, etc) at the expense of others for decades by....
1)bringing in drug shipments from Mexico & islands then moving them throughout the U.S. & into Canada, 
2)laundering money from working class & rich,
3)running a nationwide credit card scam & identity theft operation to further stuff their pockets & punish those not serving the Mafia,
4)oppressing Christians & Conservatives so white party-boy drug thugs can rule America,
5)making false promises to Blacks in order to keep them in the Democrat Party so these party-boy thugs will have a majority of votes to put white supremacists in control of our Country & its' money,
6)haunting people's lives who are anti-drug & who fight or refuse to serve the Mafia (i.e. those unwilling to become a criminal),
7)dumping drugs into Black communities so they can arrest them to keep these thug party-boy lawyers & cops employed,
8)stalking women with tracking devices & via online dating sites so Mafia men can crisscross their paths & lure them into Mafia relationships,
9)hiring attractive men to spy & then have them spy on all the worthwhile women so they can't date them which keeps the better spies single & spying for decades before they figure out the dirty game,
10)supplementing contractor's incomes who move drug shipments off boats & store them in their warehouses,
11)snooping in resident's bank accounts so they know who to prey on or when you're most vulnerable,
12)using Mafia cops to scare the hell out of residents who expose the Mafia operations & so residents believe dangers exist in order to justify massive police dept's. needed for a successful Mafia operation,
13)pairing good cops with a party-boy drug-thug cop so the oblivious good cop can be watched, brainwashed, controlled & used as a disguise to residents by the thug lawyers & cops controlling a law enforcement agency,
14)elevating & paying Gays to pull nasty stunts on Christian's in order to expand the atheist Mafia drug movement,
15)isolating those who refuse to surrender to the Mafia & become a criminal by sabotaging their relationships via endless sneaky & abusive tricks,
16)punishing those who refuse to pay or contribute to the Mafia by damaging their vehicle/property, getting companies to rip them off, forcing employers to demote or fire them, etc.
17)placing druggies into all worthwhile positions within communities (these Thugs have zero interest in your qualifications if you aren't supportive of the Mafia & okay with illegal drugs),
18)hiring educated professionals so the well-disguised trusted drug Mafia can obtain their skills & then later eliminate the anti-drug professionals (your education & experience means nothing unless you surrender a hunk of your income to the Mafia),
19)isolating women & then leaving her with only one dating opportunity which is a Mafia man who has a health issue, is an alcoholic or is old,
20)maintaining an inventory of single women so that Mafia Party-Boy Drug-Thugs are never alone or have to go without sex for any length of time,
21)trafficking those who won't surrender to the Mafia & fight the Mafia by tricking them to travel out of the country to be forced into slavery,
22)getting Democrats to register Republican & study Conservatives so they can con wealthy people & get their money,
23)elevating a few ""trophy Blacks"" so that Blacks think the Democrat Party is their ticket to freedom & equality (which gives white supremacist party boys a majority vote in elections) as they dutifully serve Democratic thugs,
24)brainwashing Americans by elevating Liberal Thugs to Broadcast Fake News,
25)strategically placing Mafia Thugs throughout communities so they have a built-in family and can spy on those residents, etc, etc.

Cops, FBI & CIA agents retire in SWFL & have turned this area into a predatory playground where they can continue spying part-time to get bonus money to live big in Paradise.  The Liberal Thugs have infiltrated schools, govt, nonprofits, banks so they can snoop into resident's accounts, hospitals, police dept, sheriff's office, state atty's office, etc.  Mafia Thug Lawyers handpick candidates, including judges, counsel the police dept. & sheriff's office & control almost all businesses.  You can't make money here for any length of time unless you are a Mafia criminal or work for an employer who serves the Mafia in some capacity, otherwise, your life is terrorized.  These Liberal Lawyers relocate Druggies & criminals from all over the U.S., coddle them like they're gold & offer them protection, especially those who do the most vicious terrorizing for the Mafia when residents refuse to serve or payoff.

THIS IS GOING ON IN MANY TOWNS IN AMERICA!  COINCIDENTALLY, THE NATIONWIDE TERRORIST MAFIA PLAYS THE SAME BRAINWASHING GAME AS MSNBC, CNN & OTHER LIBERAL THUG STATIONS WHO ARE DESTROYING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC & HELPING THE MAFIA OVER THROW OUR GOVERNMENT!  BLACKS HAVE BEEN USED BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR DECADES TO ADVANCE THE LIVES OF WHITE PARTY DRUG THUGS & THE LIBERAL MAFIA ARE TRADING WOMEN LIKE PROPERTY.

I'M A PRISONER IN MY HOME, WAITING FOR THE ARREST OF THOUSANDS OF LIBERAL TRAITORS WHO ABUSED & TORTURED THE HELL OUT OF ME & MY CHILD SINCE MOVING TO PUNTA GORDA ISLES (Developed by 2 retired CIA Agents).  I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN WHEN I HEARD HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I KNEW HE WAS THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT HAD THE SKILL & GUTS TO FIGHT THIS NATIONWIDE TERRORIST DRUG-RUNNING & MONEY-LAUNDERING MAFIA OPERATION.  ABUSIVE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ARE SCREAMING & SHOUTING BECAUSE THEIR SHIP IS SINKING & THEIR MAFIA WILL BE DESTROYED!  SAVAGES LIVING COMFORTABLY OFF BLOOD MONEY!  TRAITORS WHO SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH TREASON!  PER QANON, OVER 40,000 SEALED INDICTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS MAJOR U.S. INVESTIGATION.

I BEG LOGICAL LIBERALS TO PLEASE STOP HARASSING & INTIMIDATING LIBERALS WHO CHOOSE TO SUPPORT CONSERVATIVES & QUIT ENCOURAGING GANG INVOLVEMENT.  THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS A MAFIA DRUG PARTY THAT IS DESTROYING AMERICA!",-0.9994,0
